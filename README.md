## 🧠 Who I Am

I’m **Karlito**, a young dev who codes like he’s writing a story —  
every line, every tag, every loop means something.

I build with curiosity, I learn with passion, and I fail forward —  
because real progress comes from breaking things, fixing them,  
and smiling when it finally works at 2 AM ☕💻

I don’t code for trends.  
I code for **freedom**, for **expression**, and because **I love it**.

## 💻 My Coding World

I’m currently exploring and improving in:
- 🧩 **HTML · CSS · XML · Python**
- ⚙️ Frontend + Logic + UI/UX — I love making things both *beautiful* and *smart*.
- 🖥️ Dev setup: **Arch-based Linux**, **VS Code**, **TailwindCSS**, **terminal power user**.
- 🔍 Always curious, always learning something new.

### 🚀 Some of My Creations

#### 🧩 [Quizzy](https://github.com/badley08/Quizzy)
A multilingual quiz app that adapts to the world.  
Simple, fast, elegant — with image support and a UI that feels right.  
Made to prove that learning can look good *and* feel good.

#### 🧮 Mathlatore
A modern **scientific calculator**, built in pure HTML/CSS/JS,  
styled with **GlassMorphism**, inspired by Apple — but with my own twist.  
It calculates in real time, saves previous results, and looks *aesthetic* af 😌  

> Every project I make starts with “what if I made this my way?”

## 📱 My Tech Philosophy

- 💚 Android supremacy — especially **OnePlus**, **Pixel**, and **Samsung**.  
- ⚙️ I tweak, I mod, I explore. Because tech should be **yours**, not just *used*.  
- 🖤 I run **Arch Linux** because I love knowing exactly what’s running on my machine.  
- 🧩 I believe in **open-source freedom** — learning from everyone, sharing with purpose.

## 🎌 The Anime & Manga Energy

If code is logic, manga is emotion.  
Both teach me how to build something that *means* something.  

I grew up with stories about people who rise after falling —  
and that’s how I see programming too: every error is a training arc.  

I love characters who think deeply, fight smart, and care hard.  
They remind me to be human in a world of code.  

> “Behind every bug, there’s a story — and every fix is a new chapter.”

## 🌍 My Portfolio

💫 [**badley08.github.io/Karlito**](https://badley08.github.io/Karlito)

It’s not just a portfolio — it’s a **reflection of my growth**.  
A space where I mix design, logic, and personality.  
Every section tells a piece of who I am: developer, dreamer, and builder.  

- 🧭 Clean layout with purpose  
- 🎨 Subtle animations and transitions  
- ⚡ Constantly evolving, just like me  

---

## ⚡ Mindset

- “Don’t wait for the perfect moment — code until it becomes one.”  
- Perfection isn’t real. **Progress is.**  
- I build, I break, I rebuild. That’s how I grow.  
- Tech is my playground, not my cage.  
- I’m not here to follow the wave — I’m here to **create my own**.
