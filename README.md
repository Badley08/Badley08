## 🧩 About Me

Hey there! I’m **Karlito**, a passionate developer who’s building his journey step by step — one line of code at a time.  
I’ve got a curious mind, a love for logic, and a creative spark inspired by manga, anime, and tech.

I’m all about **creating, optimizing, and exploring** — from designing clean UIs to automating systems that just *work*.  
Whether it’s frontend design or backend logic, I enjoy pushing myself further every single project.

## 💻 What I Work With

**Languages & Tools:**
- 🌐 **HTML**, **CSS**, **XML** — because structure and style matter.  
- 🐍 **Python** — my go-to language for logic, automation, and creative tools.  
- ⚙️ **Tailwind CSS** — for sleek, responsive, minimal designs.  
- 🧠 **Arch-based Linux** user — full control, no compromises.  
- 🧩 Code Editor: **VS Code** (custom setup, dark theme supremacy 🖤).

## 🎌 Manga · Anime · Manhwa · Manhua

Yeah, that’s my second world 🌙  
When I’m not coding, I’m deep into stories that hit hard — characters who grow through pain, power, and purpose.  
I love everything from high-action battle shōnen to deep psychological or philosophical series.  

Manga taught me **persistence, creativity, and emotional storytelling** — lessons I apply directly to my coding.  
Because let’s be real: debugging feels exactly like a training arc sometimes 😭🔥

## 🧭 My Mindset

- 💥 *“Don’t chase perfection, chase progress.”*  
- 🌱 Learning every day — failure is just data.  
- ⚡ Coding isn’t just a skill; it’s a lifestyle.  
- 🧘 I respect tech traditions but always look forward to the next innovation.  
- 🧩 I blend logic, art, and purpose in everything I create.
